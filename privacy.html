  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Fun Pal</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).</p>

  <p>By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Fun Pal collects minimal personal information. We only store the player names you enter locally on your device. We do not collect or store any other personal data.</p>

  <h2>2. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not use cookies, analytics tools, advertising networks, or any form of cross-app or third-party tracking. All usage happens locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All game data and player information is stored locally on your device using secure storage methods. We do not maintain any external databases of user information.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised. The App runs entirely offline, and no data is transmitted to any server.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Fun Pal does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. We do not share any information with external parties.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Fun Pal offers a Family Mode designed for users of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
